## conventions
- When using `require once`, use it with __DIR__ . "./[pathtoffile]"
- make sure that ther isnt a sing space after ``<?php`` in all php files
- make sure that ther is no echo or print statement before ``header()`` calls
- If you're editing files on Windows, sometimes the editor (like Notepad) adds a Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the start of the file, which is invisible but counts as output. Use a good code editor like VS Code, Sublime, or PHPStorm, and save the file without BOM.
